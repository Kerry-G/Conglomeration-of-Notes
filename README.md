# Conglomeration of Notes

## Preface

Those notes are my personal notes. Most of the notes will have their material sources written in the introduction. Those are my personal notes that I feel I may need to re-read at some point to refresh my memory. I put them on GitHub in case it can help someone out there. Feel free to add anything or correct me if something is wrong.

## License

The source material will be different for most of the notes. However, if you feel like one of them violates any copyright contact me and I will remove it.

## Why an conglomeration?

It sounds pretty.
