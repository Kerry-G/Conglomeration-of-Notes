# Introduction

Modeling and design of db, Database programming.

DBMS implementation is given by a older course.

## What is a database?

It's a collection of data that exists over a long period of time (Persistent storage)

The collection should be logically coherent. Example: list of names, addresses and phone numbers of friends

## DBMS (Data base Management System)

A DBMS is a complex software package developed to store and "manage" dbs.

Database system = Database + DBMS. (DBS = DB + DBMS)

### What does it provide?

* Supports convenient, efficient and secure access and manipulation of large amounts of data
* Programming interface
* Persistent storage
* Transaction management and recovery: Control access to shared data from multiple simultaneous users with properties Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability (ACID).

## File Processing Systems (FPS)

Not good. Every dept. has their own file. Redundancy. 

## Database Systems

Data is stored in a database and every users requests informations from it.
